## Design Structure
        MVC - Model-View-Controller

        Tkinter - A GUI module that is commonly used in Python

## Application Flow 
 
   - Controller Contains methods for mediating communication between this application's modules. 
   - It also initializes and runs the Tiny Ticker application.
       - controller.tiny_ticker.ten_second_loop
            Switches the display every <cycle> seconds. This function spans a timed looping thread. Every 'cycle' seconds this
            function calls it's self to continue the loop. It is a daemon thread so it acts in the background and it calls
            controller.title_loop.call_switch_display.
       Arguments:
            - main_view -- the MainView which displays articles.
            - cycle -- the amount of time between view changes. User input from the command line.
            - feed_manager -- the FeedManager which will provide the next article to display
       - controller.tiny_ticker.call_new_feed
            Downloads the contents of the feed at the url provided, then adds the contents to the feed_manager
       Arguments:
            - feed_manager -- the FeedManager which will hold the contents of the new feed
            - new_feed_url -- The url location of the new feed
       - controller.tiny_ticker.call_switch_display
            Requests the next article from the feed_manager and prompts the view to display it.
       Arguments:
           - main_view -- the gui view which will display the next article
           - feed_manager -- the feed_manager which holds the contents of all of the feeds currently downloaded.
       - controller.tiny_ticker.main
            Gathers command-line args, loads feeds into the model, and initiates the title loop.
       Arguments:
            - mainView -- the gui view which displays feed articles
